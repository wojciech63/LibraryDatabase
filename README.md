Database I Project

Goal:
Design a database that will be used by a program that manages the library. Requirements:
• There are many books in the library, sorted into categories
• Each book may have multiple categories attached to them
• Books have authors; several books may have the same author, and several authors can be
listed in one book
• Books are rented by customers
• Some books can only be rented by customers who are of the appropriate age
• Each rental must be logged into the database
Tasks:
1. Draw an ER diagram of the database that will suit this company. Don’t be afraid to
make your own assumptions, add necessary columns and attributes and so on!
2. Transform the diagram into the relational model. Construct SQL queries that will create
a database from the relational model
3. Write SQL queries that would answer the following questions:
• What is the most popular book in the library?
• Which author is the most popular?
• For a given customer, display the books he has not yet returned
• List all the books that have still not returned after the due date (say 4 weeks)
• For every category, list the most popular book
